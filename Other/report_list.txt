REPORT  1:  The content catalog

    This is simple and straightforward.   It's two sheet spreadsheet:

        SHEET 1: Resources (with metadata:  type, code, name, etc.)
        SHEET 2: Assets (with metadata: type, code, etc.)

    We only need to create this once, and send it to each recipient who requests it.

REPORT 2: Orgs

    This is a two sheet spreadsheet:

        SHEET 1: Overall metrics:   penetration (public vs. private and combined)  for the state and US.
            (I could also make this with all the states on it and include it in REPORT 1)

        SHEET 2: List of Orgs in the state with NCES demographics, Title 1 data, # users, etc.

REPORT 3: Registration, Visits, Logins

    For V5 onwards, I'd like to delineate LOGIN from VISIT:

            - LOGIN – by a registrered user – location from ORG metadata
            - VISIT – by ANY visitor (incl. logins and non-logged in visits) - location from GeoIP

            So there are three primary metrics:
                - registration
                - logins
                - visits

        For each state report, there's:
                    State data
                    US data
                    Affiliate data
                    County data (not on list, but something a partner might want – we should be prepared)

        This is a four sheet spreadsheet:

            SHEET 1: Roll-up by  state, US, world?  Affiliate,  county?
            SHEET 2: Registration  (US/ World, State, Affiliate)   by month, cum.
            SHEET 3: by county/zip  ----  HOW?
            SHEET 3: Logins (ditto)
            SHEET 4: visits (ditto)

REPORT 4:  Content Usage

        I think this is 5 sheets

        SHEET 1: Top 100   resource views, asset views, downloads (for the state), might also reference those against US ranking for the month?
        SHEET 2: Resource Views:  state, US, world   BASED ON VISITS, NOT LOGINS
        SHEET 3: Asset Views: ditto BASED ON VISITS, NOT LOGINS
        SHEET 4: Downloads: ditto BASED ON VISITS, NOT LOGINS
        SHEET 5: Collections:  List by collection, total asset views, resource views, downloads, home page views  (state, US, world?) BASED ON VISITS, NOT LOGINS

    NOTE That cumulative reports will have to be V5 ONLY OR we'll have to lookup every visit back to 2002 (and I'm not sure how to get accurate data
        for those earlier months!).  OR we can make the partner responsible for cumulation on their own (my preference).
