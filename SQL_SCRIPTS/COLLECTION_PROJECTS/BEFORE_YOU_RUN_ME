Did you update the metrics_month_id_range table?

ALSO - make sure that the resource and asset tables have UNIQUE INDEXES on code.
For some reason the Django model didn't take care of this..

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX by_code ON td_now.asset(code);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX by_code ON td_now.resource(code);


Otherwise I'll never finish!
