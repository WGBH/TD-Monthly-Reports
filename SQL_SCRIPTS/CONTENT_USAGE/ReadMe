Dear Bob:

If you get an error like this:

ERROR 126 (HY000) at line 2: Incorrect key file for table '#sql_fa2_0.MYI'; try to repair it


the problem might be that you haven't get enough rows in the
td_analytics.metrics_month_id_range table.

To wit: you're trying to process rows from April when the table only 
goes to March.

Solution:  make sure the table encompasses the entire range of dates 
that are (now) in td_analytics.metrics_page_hits.

Sincerely,
Bob  :-)
